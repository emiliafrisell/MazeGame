# Escape from Hyper Island

## World 5 - Pleasantville - Level 4 - The Maze

---

Hyper Island - Exploring Code Module - May 2021

### Brief:

As a team of 6, create a game with each person making an individual level with three challenges. Come up with a 'world concept' together as a team, but each person can choose what tech stack they want to work with and what their challenges should be.

### Brief Length:

4 weeks

### Goals:

Our team wanted to create a cohesive experience and story where each level builds on the story of the previous one. My level is the fourth out of six and is focused around getting through a corn maze.
Meet the briefs minimal requirements and don't get carried away and ambitious. I wanted to focus on building my portfolio instead since I think I'm gonna need that one more than this timer app.

### Solution:

I decided to create a very basic pomodoro timer. I wanted it to loop some music while the timer is on since I find it easier to focus with classical or instrumental music, and then stop the music when the timer stops.

### Learnings:

- Working with the Date object in JavaScript which I have never done before
- Time is valuable, and I can decide how to use my time more efficiently
- Refactoring and bug-solving and the insight that I sometimes get a bit narrowminded. Sometimes it takes less time to take a new approach to the whole code than solving that one little bug
- Code effiency
- More understanding of the useEffect hook
- I need to get better at taking breaks before getting frustrated and hitting the 'I'm the most stupid person ever'-mode

### Tech used in this specific repository:

- React
- [useSound](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/use-sound)
- [Date object in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date)
