Hyper Island - The First App module - Brief 9.

### :scroll: Brief:

Create an accessible Pomodoro timer that counts down from 25 minutes and that you can reset after it is done using a framework. Extra challanges are to make a nice design, make it possible to change the time, add break time, add tasks, connect to an API like trello or make it as a PWA.

### :hourglass: Time spent:

3 days.

### :checkered_flag: Goals:

Meet the briefs minimal requirements and don't get carried away and ambitious. I wanted to focus on building my portfolio instead since I think I'm gonna need that one more than this timer app.

### :heavy_check_mark: Solution:

I decided to create a very basic pomodoro timer. I wanted it to loop some music while the timer is on since I find it easier to focus with classical or instrumental music, and then stop the music when the timer stops.

### :closed_book: Learnings:

- Working with the Date object in JavaScript which I have never done before
- Time is valuable, and I can decide how to use my time more efficiently
- Refactoring and bug-solving and the insight that I sometimes get a bit narrowminded. Sometimes it takes less time to take a new approach to the whole code than solving that one little bug
- Code effiency
- More understanding of the useEffect hook
- I need to get better at taking breaks before getting frustrated and hitting the 'I'm the most stupid person ever'-mode
